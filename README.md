# NP_MS
NCTU Network Programming for M.S. student
This is my code for NP course.

The homework spec is placed in "hw_provide" of each project.

The test data is placed in "test" of each project, and maybe have some answers.

For project1, you have to compile commands and place the executable files in ras/bin, then type "make" and "cd ras/" to exe server.o and exe client.o to connect server.

For project2, just type "make" then the "cd" to single or concurrent directory to exe server and also use client.o to connect server.

For project3, we have to write cgi and http server, and use winsocket to write both, so I split them into three parts.

For project4, add a sock server between communication.

p.s. if you don't know how to exe these file, just open my code!!
p.s. project3 has some bugs, however, others can get all the grade.
